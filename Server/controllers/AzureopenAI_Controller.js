    Scores will be from 0-100 based on how well each pet profile matches the user's responses for Traits, Lifestyle, and Extra Context. Each pet profile must be given a unique score.

    Extra Context: ${petContext.extraContext}

    Pet Profiles: ${petProfileString}

    IMPORTANT: Return a JSON array with all the profiles ranked in descending order of their score. The array should contain ALL pet profiles
